Hello!

This README file contains instructions for video "Explanation: Charging Fines to Patrons", S3V4.

Your instructions are as follows:

1) Add a property called `dailyFine`, initialized to `.1` to the Library class constructor method.

2) Add a property called `balance`, initialized to `0` to the Patron class constructor method.

3) Add a method called `chargeFines()` to the Library class that finds all Patrons with overdue books and charges them the daily fine for every day their book is late.
